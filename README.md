#
Ansible playbook containing ansible config modules.

Recently added show and config playbooks for ease of use but try to use tasks as roles in the roles/ folder as Ansible best practice.

Roles now include:

Config

Ping

System

Banner

Logging

Config-template

For running site.yml, comment or uncomment roles as needed.
